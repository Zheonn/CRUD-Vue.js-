# CRUD With VUE

Welcome to my first oficial project! This is a very simple CRUD that simulates the POKEDEX, so you can add the pokemons you find with their name and a picture!


## How use?

- Download the ZIP.
- Extract the files
- Open your terminal
- Go to the path where the files are
- Install JSON SERVER (if you DON'T have) using this command (npm install -g json-server)
- In the path access the "vue-crud" folder and type this command (npm install) to install the dependencies of this project
- In same path type this command (npm run serve) to start the VUE
- Open another terminal
- Go to the path where the files are again
- In the path access the "vue-crud" folder and before the "data" folder. Type this command (json-server --watch db.json) to start the JSON SERVER
- Open your browser
- Go to the link "http://localhost:8080/admin/"
- Enjoy!
